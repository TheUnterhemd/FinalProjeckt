Our Mission

Our Mission is to create connection.
We want to enable people to feel at home right where they are
by creating a way to easily connect with others around them through a shared goal.

Our Goals

We want to support learners in their strive for knowledge and excercise, and teachers in their search for an easy way to offer their knowledge to others.
Simply put, LocalTrainer does that, by offering a platform where teachers can offer courses (on- and offline) and learners can book those.
